      Birmingham is a major city in England’s West Midlands region, with multiple Industrial Revolution-era landmarks
      that speak to its 18th-century history as a manufacturing powerhouse. It’s also home to a network of canals, many
      of which radiate from Sherborne Wharf and are now lined with trendy cafes and bars. In the city centre, the
      Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery is known for pre-Raphaelite masterpieces.
